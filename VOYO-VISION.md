# VOYO - AI-Native Music Discovery

## The Positioning

**VOYO** - Where music finds YOU

> No library. No search required. Just swipe and vibe.
> AI learns your taste and discovers tracks from the entire internet.
> African music. Global reach. Zero friction.

## What Makes VOYO Different

| Traditional App | VOYO |
|----------------|------|
| Database → Search → Play | AI → Discover → Play → Learn |
| You find music | Music finds you |
| Static library | Infinite discovery |
| Licensing deals | YouTube + AI |

## The VOYO Loop

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│                   THE VOYO LOOP                     │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│  User Plays  →  DJ Learns  →  Gemini Searches       │
│       ↑                              ↓              │
│       └──── Pool Grows ←── Real YouTube IDs ←──┘    │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

## Core Architecture

- **poolCurator.ts** → Bootstrap + fallback (backend search)
- **intelligentDJ.ts** → AI-powered discovery (Gemini finds YouTube URLs)
- **trackPoolStore** → Hot/cold pool with scoring
- **YouTube iframes** → No licensing, infinite content

## The Breakthrough (Dec 24, 2024)

We solved the biggest barrier to building a music platform:
**Content discovery without owning the content.**

The AI IS the library. Without the intelligent DJ, there's no content.
The AI finds the music, learns your vibe, and keeps discovering.

## Tagline Options

- "Music that finds you"
- "AI-powered African music discovery"
- "The lightweight music experience"
- "Swipe. Vibe. Discover."

## Target: African Music First

Focus genres:
- Afrobeats
